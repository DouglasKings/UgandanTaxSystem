# UgandaTaxSystem
This code defines several classes (`Ambulance`, `Estate`, `Sedan`, `SUV`, `Trailer`) that inherit from a base class `Vehicle`. Each subclass overrides methods from the base class and adds its own functionality. The base class `Vehicle` provides a structure for storing vehicle details and includes methods for setting vehicle type, plate system, and transportation mode, as well as calculating various taxes and fees based on these attributes. The subclasses add additional properties and calculations specific to their types, such as ambulance-specific duties and estate-specific taxes. This design allows for a clear separation of concerns and easy extension for new vehicle types.

The taxes payable by a tax payer for the importation of a used motor vehicle from Japan are determined by the tax authority (Uganda Revenue Authority) basing on the following tax guidance rules: -
Tax Rates:
Import Duty (ID) – 25% of the CIF
Value Added Tax (VAT) – 18% of the CIF
Withholding Tax (WHT) – 6% of the CIF
Infrastructure Levy (IL) – This is a flat amount of 150,000
Stamp Duty (SD) – This is a flat amount of 35,000
Form Fees (FF) – This is a flat amount of 20,000
Excise Duty (ED) – This is a flat amount of 200,000
Registration (R) – This amount payable is determined by the type of number plate system issued to the vehicle. Analog Plate Systems (APS) call for a flat rate of 300,000 while Digital Plate Systems (DPS) call for flat amount of 700,000.
